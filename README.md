# Top Features Selected by XGBoost to Predict ADP to Synapse Conversion

Herein are the Interpretation Techniques and final Machine Learning model designed for the Rice University ELEC-578 [Kaggle Neuron Synapse Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/t/c0f648f10def4a72a8e6358f12751c4a) competition in partnership with the [MICrONS Consortium](https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3).

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software. 
- [Python version 3.11.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/) was used for [Interpretability Methods ](ELEC_578_InterpMethods.ipynb) and the [Model](ELEC-578_CompNotebook_SUB_0.75751.ipynb).
- See [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) for instructions on installing a [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package in a Python environment.
- Libraried used can be installed via [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) package installer.

## Acknowledgments

  - We express our gratitude for the generousity of the Neuroscientists and Members at the [Andreas Tolias Lab](https://toliaslab.org) of the [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/#hdr-search) and participants of the [MICrONS Consortium](https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3). For this opportunity would not have been available whithout their arduous data reconstruction efforts.
  - We also extend this gratitude to [Genevera Allen](http://genevera.rice.edu) and the Teaching Assistants of ELEC-578 for fostering the collaboration to formulate a class project and competition out of the opportunity; which enriched the repertoire of the students and provided the Neuroscientists with invaluable inferences and information.
